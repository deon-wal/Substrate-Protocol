        const text = `I am a Structural Analyst. To the citizens of Aldersyth, this city is a marvel of post-gravity engineering; to me, it is a persistent technical failure of vector misalignments. 

I don’t see "ethereal beauty" in the Spire District’s walkways; I see a 12% gravitational fluctuation that I felt in my joints before the alarms even pulsed. The air thickened into a soup of unpredictable weight, making every step feel like wading through wet concrete. My inner ear clicked as the pressure dropped toward a vacuum.

Twenty feet ahead, a melon slipped from a vendor's stall. In a stable environment, it would have dropped. Here, it caught a low-gravity pocket and accelerated along a skewed trajectory. It didn't float; it hunted. It aimed for my head with the velocity of a low-caliber bullet. I dropped. The carbon-fiber cobblestones were freezing, vibrating with the sub-sonic hum of the city's failing stabilizers. Above me, the fruit shattered against a pylon, spraying pulp like shrapnel. The juice didn't run down; it crawled upward, defying the 1.0g baseline.

Behind me, Finn’s espresso cart rattled past. He wasn’t a "whimsical vendor"; he was a man losing sixty credits an hour to gravity spikes. "Calibrate your stabilizers, Finn!" I yelled. I rolled as a ceramic cup launched from his counter. Because the pressure was high but the gravity was low, the coffee didn't form spheres; it atomized into a scalding, bitter mist that scorched my lungs. "Tell the Council to fix the containment!" Finn barked back. He hadn't slept in three days. He was a prisoner of the physics he served.

I looked up at the gantry. Sloane, Lead Theorist, was there. Her tablet glowed with real-time telemetry. To her, Finn’s ruined stock wasn't a tragedy; it was a data point. She didn't check if I was hurt; she checked the curve on her screen.

The maintenance logs show forty-two similar incidents in three hours, yet no repair crews have been dispatched. The stabilization sub-routines are being bypassed manually. Aldersyth hadn’t had a human override since autonomy was ratified, and Sloane held the only key to the logic core. 

This isn't a malfunction; it’s a controlled experiment. The floor was drawing 1.2g more than the atmosphere. The city is being pushed to its structural limits to see which materials—and which people—snap first.
